-- Title      : Simulation Speedup Controller
-- Project    : 10 Gigabit Ethernet PCS/PMA Core
-- File       : top_ten_gig_eth_pcs_pma_0_0_sim_speedup_controller.vhd
-- Author     : Advanced Micro Devices Inc.
-- Description: This module provides a parameterizable simulation
--              speedup controller which requires a rising edge on 
--              the control input to set the output to the SIM_VALUE
--              parameter. Otherwise the output is fixed at the
--              SYNTH_VALUE parameter.
